### 📘 Theory

#### **Mean**
The **arithmetic mean** is the result of dividing the sum of all numbers in a set by their total count.  

- 🧮 *Example in data analysis:* Average customer purchase amount  
- 🤖 *Example in ML:* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

#### **Mode**
The **mode** is the value that appears most often in a dataset.  

- 🛍️ *Example in data analysis:* The most popular item in an online store  
- 🧠 *Example in ML:* Choosing the final class by model voting

---

#### **Median**
The **median** is the middle value in an ordered list of numbers.  
It divides a dataset in half — 50% of the values are smaller, and 50% are larger.

- 💰 *Example in data analysis:* Median salary  
- ⚙️ *Example in ML:* Median Absolute Error

---

### 🧾 Answer Format

Output **three numbers** on a single line, separated by a space:  
first the **mean**, then the **mode**, and then the **median**.

#### ✅ Example Output

99 3.14 2.72
